# Euro-Area Banking Case Study (2019–2024)

This repository contains the analysis of the euro-area banking sector between **2019 and 2024**.  
The study focuses on financial stability, profitability, and risk management, using data from **BankFocus** and applying standardized selection criteria to ensure consistency across 18 euro-area countries.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to evaluate systemic trends in euro-area banking by analyzing:  

- **Profitability**: Net Interest Margin (NIM), Return on Average Equity (ROAE)  
- **Capitalization**: Tier 1 Capital Ratio  
- **Asset Quality**: Impaired Loans Ratio  

The methodology includes a country-level aggregation weighted by **Assets Under Management (AUM)** and classification of countries into three groups based on GDP per capita compared to the euro-area average.

## Key Metrics

- **Net Interest Margin (NIM)**: Indicator of profitability from core banking operations.  
- **Return on Average Equity (ROAE)**: Profitability relative to shareholders’ equity.  
- **Tier 1 Capital Ratio**: Measure of solvency and risk absorption capacity.  
- **Impaired Loan Ratio**: Share of non-performing loans within total assets.  

## Results

- **NIM**: Stable 2019–2021, sharp increase in 2023 with ECB rate hikes, correction in 2024.  
- **ROAE**: Decline during COVID-19 (2020), recovery in 2021–2022, peak in 2023, stabilization in 2024.  
- **Tier 1 Ratio**: Generally stable (15–20%), temporary spike during COVID-19 crisis, normalization post-2022.  
- **Impaired Loans**: Strong decline in Greece and Cyprus, stable low ratios in developed economies, slight uptick 2023–2024.  

## Conclusion

The euro-area banking sector has shown:  
- Improved asset quality and reduced systemic risk.  
- Stable capitalization, complying with Basel III.  
- Profitability strongly shaped by ECB monetary policy.  

While overall convergence is visible, specific countries (e.g., Greece, Cyprus, Ireland) reveal structural weaknesses and divergent resilience levels.
